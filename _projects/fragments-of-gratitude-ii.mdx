<WrappableParagraph title="Fragments of Gratitude Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be only related to 07th Expansion content. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from 07th Expansion.
- **You cannot make arrangements of free of use/licensed music from 07th Expansion games, with the exception of tracks composed by -45 and Koji Kusanagi. This mainly concerns the first four episodes of Higurashi, and Ciconia Phase 1.** If you are not aware of which tracks are free of use or not, please ask us by all means. This rule is fixed on a very case-by-case situation, so please ask us beforehand.
- No original music from fangames should be arranged.
- You cannot re-arrange tracks from other doujin albums. Slight and obvious references may be permitted depending on how important it is to the track. This is a subject of discussion, so make sure to ask and show us an example if you plan on doing this.
- [Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_qouOyImf4eu7gAu_tRTvOvcTpjkS65Kybe9MtO5zbM/edit?usp=sharing). Tracks from the last released album are generally on cooldown. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well.
- Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes long, and cannot exceed 10 minutes.
- If you feel inspired, It’s possible for you to make original work for the album. This is kind of a blurry line, but the only requirement is that your track needs to “feel related” to the aimed product in some way. The general idea behind original/image work is that you need to compose and arrange your track in spirit with the Series, a character, a place, a scene, etc. You’ll of course need to specify what product you’re trying to represent. For those kinds of submissions, you will need to add a comment to explain how your track is related to whatever product you aim to represent.
- Your track may only represent those titles:
    - Higurashi Series (Any Game)
    - Umineko Series (Any Game)
    - Ciconia Series
    - Higanbana no Saku Yoru ni
    - ROSE GUNS DAYS
    - TRianThology
