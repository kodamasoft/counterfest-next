<WrappableParagraph title="Moonstruck Analogy Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be only related to TYPE-MOON content. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from TYPE-MOON.
- No original music from fangames should be arranged.
- You cannot re-arrange tracks from other doujin albums. Slight and obvious references may be permitted depending on how important it is to the track. This is a subject of discussion, so make sure to ask and show us an example if you plan on doing this.
- [Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0FQD-40D8jDWyEL4v2caypPzDJ7OgmXDJ9AY711cKM/edit?usp=sharing). Tracks from the last released album are generally on cooldown. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well.
- Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes long, and cannot exceed 10 minutes.
- If you feel inspired, It’s possible for you to make original work for the album. This is kind of a blurry line, but the only requirement is that your track needs to “feel related” to the aimed product in some way. The general idea behind original/image work is that you need to compose and arrange your track in spirit with the Series, a character, a place, a scene, etc. You’ll of course need to specify what product you’re trying to represent. For those kinds of submissions, you will need to add a comment to explain how your track is related to whatever product you aim to represent.
- Your track may only represent those titles:
    - Kara no Kyoukai
    - Tsukihime / A piece of blue glass moon (+ Melty Blood, Kagetsu Tohya…)
    - Fate/stay Night (+ Fate/ spinoff (Fate/hollow ataraxia, /EXTRA, /Grand Order, /EXTELLA…))
    - Mahoutsukai no Yoru: Witch on the Holy Night
    - Any piece of written publication (Original Novels, Mangas…)
    - Any piece of animation related to TYPE-MOON
