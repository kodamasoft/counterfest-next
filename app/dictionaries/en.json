			"description": "On this page, you can have direct access to our current COUNTERFEST RECORDS album plans and projects, to which you can participate at any time. Note that unlike KodamaSounds, album sequels aren’t as likely, as we prefer doing brand new projects all the time. We also don’t plan on always publishing albums during events such as M3 and Comic Market. Albums release and happen when we just feel like it. If you want to suggest a project to us, please contact us or join our Discord community. Our operating system is similar to KodamaSounds, but with more lax and lenient rules. Please check them out here."

No popularity contest, no favoritism: You wanna hop in? You can! And if you’re struggling, we’ll help out."
