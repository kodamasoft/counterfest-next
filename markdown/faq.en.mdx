# FAQ/Additional Information

*This section is dedicated to general guidelines that apply to all of our projects. Though not as strict as KodamaSounds, it will be appreciated if you can get through it all to have a better grasp at the way the circle works.*


<WrappableParagraph title="General Rules">
The rules below apply to anyone willing to participate.
- Do not participate if you do not have basic empathy, or sense of respect towards other people. This should go without saying, but any kind of toxic/aggressive misdemeanors are prohibited. Our circle is centered around inclusivity and diversity. If this is not not part of your values, please do not apply.
- (Not mandatory but highly recommended) Participate in the project’s general discussions on the [KodamaSounds discord](/discord). If you wanna participate, say hi and tell us you’re here for that, and you shall gain access to the private artists channel. Since this is a community project, we’ll need to have you be okay with communicating about your art alongside a bunch of other artists. 
- Keep secrecy on the project, especially when it comes to work that isn’t yours.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Production Procedure">
1. It is recommended to participate on the [Discord server of the community](/discord) or get in contact with the album supervisors through Email, Discord, or Twitter DMs (contact info is available on each project page) to ensure your song stays within the theme. Feel free to post works in progress or ask questions in the project channels.
2. Once you think your song is complete, please submit it on the appropriate Google Form. The supervisor may get in touch with you again to confirm your formatted credits for the album.
3. If you chose to see your master supervised, we will get in touch with you to confirm satisfaction of your mastered song before release.
4. Once mastering of the album has been fully finalised, you will get your fully mastered song alongside assets (artwork, cover art, logo) to promote your song before and after release.
5. Make sure to follow the [terms of use](https://counterfest.kodamasoft.net/en/faq#terms-of-use) for your song after release.

<WrappableParagraph title="Album / Track Rules">
- Your track for the album must not have been previously published on any platform, and must be entirely new/original. The only exception to this rule is if you wish to remake a track you’ve produced before in the form of a very different sounding shape.
- Send us complete and objective credits for your works. Be transparent with information. We WILL need as much information as we possibly can to make accurate credits. More information in the appropriate topics below.
- Artist name must not exceed 45 characters (both japanese and romanized).
- Track name must not exceed 60 roman characters and 25 japanese characters (for kanji only tracks).
- We may ask you to change your track name/artist name if it’s inappropriate or too dense/long. Special symbols and weird characters can be authorized to some extent.
- Keep secrecy on your track. You can post WIPs on social media, but make it just a little section. You may post your full work in progress on the appropriate Discord channel. You can announce that you participate in the album, but please do not share anything related to the album’s direct content until announcement.
- Sampling must be explicit - it’s okay to sample from games, anime, etc, so long as it’s within the spirit of the album. It should be okay to sample from commercial products in most cases. Just stay logical and fair, and do not claim other people’s work as your own, or sampling from existing doujin/independent artists.
- Follow the album’s theme. We’re looking for anything that would fit in the styles mentioned in the album page. Ask us and show us examples if you have doubts on what you can do.
- You are free to send as many songs as you want for projects, but please make sure to curate your submissions. The more you submit, the more strict we will be about quality.
- We authorize anyone to participate and contribute to the albums, but please understand that we have quality/selection standards which may affect our decision to add your submission to the album. Please do not take it the wrong way if that ever happens - we can always discuss to see if your submission can be improved on and the community will be glad to help you out if we think the song has some potential for the album in question, or a different one altogether.

<WrappableParagraph title="Mix/Mastering">
Please follow those rules for the final mix of your track, and export it with those settings:
- WAV 44.1 kHz / 24bit
- Headroom around -6db to -12db.
- Do not use any Limiter or Clipper on the Mix Bus.

### Side notes
- Going through our own mastering engineer is not necessary if your track already went through professional Mixing/Mastering, or if you are a professional yourself. But please note that we may post-master your track lightly if the sound is deemed too strong/low compared to the rest of the tracks on the album.
- Same above rules apply to full tracks or individual tracks in case of mastering by stems.
- Make sure your mix is as accurate as you can make it. The point of mastering isn't about fixing mixing errors, but about improving the sound of the final release.
- If you are not sure about the sound of your final mix, you can share it on our Discord community if you want a second opinion from other artists or the album’s mastering engineer.

<WrappableParagraph title="File Information">
Please go through the project's Google Forms enclosed on each project page to send us your track, and link to a direct upload (or folder) of your finalized mix. Please go through a hosting site like Google Drive/MEGA, and make sure that you sent us the access key for the file so we can download and gain access to it. Filling the Google Forms is mandatory for submissions, because it features all of the required fields for the song’s credits, alongside being easier on our workflow. If you truly cannot use the Google Form for a specific reason, please contact us directly so we can make it work.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Transparency & Revenues">
Unlike KodamaSounds albums, COUNTERFEST RECORDS albums are completely free. The main reason for this is because most albums are sampling-heavy, which is a grey area when it comes to distribution. Artists contributing to the circle must understand this before submitting to us. Our intention is to stay non lucrative as much as possible, and we don’t intend to make digital sales of the albums. Any Bandcamp sale is set to “name your price”, and any income we get from eventual sale is considered a bonus, and used directly to fund the project as a whole, including KodamaSounds. We plan on selling physical items such as CDs. Contributing artists will always receive a copy of the album, and any revenues acquired from selling those are just intended to break even from the costs of manufacturing the albums in the first place.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Deadlines">
Deadlines are projects specific, and are generally pretty lax. Deadlines and intended releases are much less rigid than on KodamaSounds. For the most part they are not intended to release at the same time as events, but some may line up at the same time as Comic Market or M3.
