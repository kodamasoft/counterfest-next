# WHAT IS COUNTERFEST RECORDS?!
**COUNTERFEST RECORDS** is the 2025 planned Bootleg Sub-Label for **KodamaSounds**. The objective of COUNTERFEST RECORDS is to publish **free** albums (both compilations and solo releases), and to let anyone interested in organizing their own album projects to publish them for free there, if it follows our vision for the label. The idea behind the label is to motivate all kinds of free album compilations, with no fear of restrictions and possible DMCAs for publishing derivative works, in all kinds of ways, in a way less serious mood than KodamaSounds normally would. This new sub-label decision is to offer artists better opportunities to craft what they want for the future or for our tribute albums, and to ensure a safe future for KodamaSounds, as the circle is gathering more and more attention than it ever did. 

# What's the core idea behind COUNTERFEST RECORDS?
- A more leftfield environment to create unique albums with no profit in mind - both for original albums, and tribute albums.
- A label which supports all kinds of music and counter cultures - the more specific, the better.
- More artistic freedom and a fairer ground for all.
- Less ambitious (but just as crazy) releases, with a wider variation of concepts and ideas.
- Concepts originating from the art of bootleg remixes & marginalized/experimental styles of music.
- No BS, and free content!

# What about already existing tribute albums concepts?
Current KodamaSounds "tribute album" releases are planned to stay where they are at right now, but will be changed to free/name your price. **We do not plan to offer refunds for previously purchased tribute albums**, and we hope that you will understand that this is with best intentions in mind. Starting 2025 and beyond, all of our future tribute albums (and more) are planned to release on COUNTERFEST RECORDS, on a different Bandcamp account (and also available as direct downloads on a newly dedicated website). COUNTERFEST RECORDS albums are intended as free, and any eventual purchases will used for COUNTERFEST RECORDS & KodamaSounds opperational funds - such as free download credit, cloud archival of our releases, eventual necessary comissions, etc.

# I'm an artist, what about royalties?
__Simple for future albums:__ We will be using a strict non-commercial pattern for COUNTERFEST. **No royalties are planned for anyone whatsoever.** Any possible income (made through Bandcamp name your price settings) will be used for operational costs (as mentioned above) and considered as donations.
__For previously released tribute albums:__ Royalties will be stopped once we move all albums to Free/Name your Price, and all accumulated revenues so far will be sent to artists as it always has been - royalties will simply just stop once the new formula is in place. As much as I assume most artists will be okay with this conclusion, **if artists are discontent with the change, things can be negotiated with me directly.**
