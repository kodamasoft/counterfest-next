# Katamania!! -a Katamari tribute album-

*Nanaaaa-nanananaaa~... Who doesn’t love Katamari? If there’s one game series that embraces love, care, pure fun and beauty into one, it’s this one. Now show us what you’re made of, and come roll with us with your  musical talent, and let’s take the world by storm with a BEAUTIFUL Katamari filled with LOVE and music, FOREVER and ever!*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“Katamania!!” is a variant of  our “tribute album” series, where the featured tracks are all centered around the Katamari Damacy video games. Everyone who has played the series or has listened to music from the series, everyone knows that Katamari has a special vibe: Creativity has no bounds, and it’s all about making something fun or beautiful alongside friends. Original work inspired by the general vibe of the series will also be accepted.

<WrappableParagraph title="Katamania!! Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be only related to the Katamari series. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from the Katamari series.
- [Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8N2Tg-T1osQBrlga-PUq4g35UX8vxlpV9b7bH_0Ew0/edit?usp=sharing). Tracks from the last released Katamania!! album will also be on cooldown. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well. 
- Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes long, and cannot exceed 11 minutes.
- If you feel inspired, It’s possible for you to make original work for the album. This is kind of a blurry line, but the only requirement is that your track needs to “feel related” to the aimed product in some way. The general idea behind original/image work is that you need to compose and arrange your track in spirit with the Series, a character, a place, a scene, etc. You’ll of course need to specify what product you’re trying to represent. For those kinds of submissions, you will need to add a comment to explain how your track is related to whatever product you aim to represent.
- Your track may only represent those titles:
    - Katamari Damacy
    - We Love Katamari
    - Me & My Katamari
    - Beautiful Katamari
    - Katamari Forever
    - Touch my Katamari
    - Any other Katamari spin-off
