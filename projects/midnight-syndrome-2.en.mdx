# MIDNIGHT SYNDROME 2 -a Grasshopper Manufacture tribute album-

*It's kill or be killed. Few fictional universes can live up to SUDA51 and his "Kill the Past" meta-series. From The Silver Case to No More Heroes III, this new tribute album project will be focused on this grand franchise that is surprisingly well tied-in from one game to another. Through Death and Rebirth, we will make sure that this album stays in your memories forever.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
"MIDNIGHT SYNDROME” is a variant of  our “tribute album” series, where the featured tracks are all centered around SUDA51 & Grasshopper Manufacture video games. This franchise envelops a lot of different video games and alternative media (books, manga) created by SUDA51. You may have played or enjoyed a game soundtrack you didn't even know was part of the "Kill the Past" series in the past! Original work inspired by the original games will also be accepted.

<WrappableParagraph title="MIDNIGHT SYNDROME Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be only related to the Kill the Past series. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from the Kill the Past universe.
- [Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPBM_J1qO3YV0jm8YlyBhfHjIcqyXdkvrJjoHD3U850/edit?usp=sharing). Tracks from the last released MIDNIGHT SYNDROME album will also be on cooldown. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well. 
- Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes long, and cannot exceed 11 minutes.
- If you feel inspired, It’s possible for you to make original work for the album. This is kind of a blurry line, but the only requirement is that your track needs to “feel related” to the aimed product in some way. The general idea behind original/image work is that you need to compose and arrange your track in spirit with the Series, a character, a place, a scene, etc. You’ll of course need to specify what product you’re trying to represent. For those kinds of submissions, you will need to add a comment to explain how your track is related to whatever product you aim to represent.
- Your track may only represent those titles:
    - Moonlight & Twilight Syndrome
    - The Silver Case & The 25th Ward
    - Flower, Sun, and Rain
    - killer7
    - No More Heroes Series
    - Any other SUDA51 / Grasshopper Manufacture directed game (ask if unsure)
