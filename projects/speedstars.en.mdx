# SpeedSTARS -a Ridge Racer tribute album-

_“Alright everyone, one minute to go! Are you ready to go?” SpeedSTARS is our tribute album dedicated to the RIDGE RACER series, to celebrate the series in all its glory. Ahead of its time, the series managed to bring elements of European EDM onto Arcade CRT screens as far back as the early 90’s, back when VGM was just starting to get into serious territory. Dearly beloved by many, SpeedSTARS will celebrate this in a multitude of genres and styles._

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
    “SpeedSTARS -a Ridge Racer tribute album-” is a tribute album focused on
    NAMCO’s Ridge Racer series. To celebrate its historic and immense library of
    songs, we are organising this compilation to celebrate NAMCO’s 70th
    anniversary. Pick your favourite music from any game, and arrange it into
    something that’s truly yours, to celebrate the undeniable footprint of the
    most prestigious arcade racing game series out there!

<WrappableParagraph title="SpeedSTARS Specific Music Rules">

Your submission must be only related to Ridge Racer games. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from the concerned games. If you have doubt about a certain game being part of the selection, feel free to ask.

Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells. Tracks from the last released SpeedSTARS album will also be on cooldown. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well.

Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes long, and cannot exceed 11 minutes.

If you feel inspired, It’s possible for you to make original work for the album. This is kind of a blurry line, but the only requirement is that your track needs to “feel related” to the aimed product in some way. The general idea behind original/image work is that you need to compose and arrange your track in spirit with the Series, a character, a place, a scene, etc. You’ll of course need to specify what product you’re trying to represent. For those kinds of submissions, you will need to add a comment to explain how your track is related to whatever product you aim to represent.
