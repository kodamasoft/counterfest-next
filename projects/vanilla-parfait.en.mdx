# Vanilla Parfait -a Vanillaware tribute album-

*From GrimGrimoire to 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, while going through Muramasa, Odin Sphere and many others, Vanillaware games have been targeting a loveable niche of players for two decades now. The audiovisual quality of their craftsmanship, mixed with the variety of their unique expertise have marked them down as some of the best japanese game studios of all time.  Most soundtracks of their games being produced by Basiscape, with a wide range of composers, we’re looking at dozens of hours of exquisite music to pick out from, in an insanely varied scope of styles and genres to love.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
"Vanilla Parfait” is a variant of our “tribute album” series, where the featured tracks are all centered around Vanillaware developed video games. This franchise encompasses a lot of different video games, and if you’re a veteran player, there’s a huge chance you might find one of your favorite games ever in their past productions. Original work inspired by the original games will also be accepted.

<WrappableParagraph title="Vanilla Parfait Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be only related to Vanillaware games. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from the concerned games.
- [Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wOwg9XN-YtTYAWPFQm8rC8iFqPfVTlEcUafQ7cszm7I/edit?usp=sharing). Tracks from the last released Vanilla Parfait album will also be on cooldown. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well. 
- Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes long, and cannot exceed 11 minutes.
- If you feel inspired, It’s possible for you to make original work for the album. This is kind of a blurry line, but the only requirement is that your track needs to “feel related” to the aimed product in some way. The general idea behind original/image work is that you need to compose and arrange your track in spirit with the Series, a character, a place, a scene, etc. You’ll of course need to specify what product you’re trying to represent. For those kinds of submissions, you will need to add a comment to explain how your track is related to whatever product you aim to represent.
- Your track may only represent those titles:
    - GrimGrimoire
    - Odin Sphere
    - Muramasa: The Demon Blade & Rebirth
    - Dragon’s Crown
    - 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim
    - UNICORN OVERLORD
    - Any other Vanillaware developed game (ask if unsure)
